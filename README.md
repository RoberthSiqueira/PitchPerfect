# PitchPerfect
nanodegree project from Udacity

The project's concept record the voice's user after stops recording then there are some ways to playback that voice recorded.

Options that recorded voice will reproduce:
- slow
- fast
- squirrel
- Darth Vader (particularly my favorite option)
- echo
- reverb

## View Code

I feel more comfortable using code to create the app's UI instead Interface Builder tools. The lessons use Storyboard. 
Since I used view code in a big project with different developers it is my favorite way because focusing on maintenance and readable statement, in my opinion, is better.

## Next Steps

Maybe in the future, I could visit this project to change the architecture, UI and increment new playback options.
